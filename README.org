Tool to backtest heat pump performance on real temperature data
* Method
The heat pump is modelled based on several working points from the datasheet,
i.e. combinations of air and water temperature as well as the corresponding COP.
Other values are modelled as the theoretical COP multiplied by the ratio of actual
over theoretical COP at the nearest working point.
